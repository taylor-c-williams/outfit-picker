# New Dawn
A framework for presenting a Web interface using native CSS replications of the Mac OS 8.1 interface components.  The project's name is a play on After Dark, as [`after-dark-css`](https://github.com/bryanbraun/after-dark-css) inspired this framework and provided the foundational window layout.
